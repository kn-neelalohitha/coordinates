# Cartesian Coordinate System

A Cartesian coordinate system (also called Rectangular coordinate system) is a coordinate system that specifies each point uniquely in a plane by a set of numerical coordinates (_X_ and _Y_ coordinates), which are the signed distances to the point from two fixed perpendicular oriented lines, measured in the same unit of length. Each reference line is called a coordinate axis (_X_-axis and _Y_-axis) or just axis (plural axes) of the system, and the point where they meet is its origin, at ordered pair (0, 0).

## X-Coordinate

It is the perpendicular distance of the point from the _Y_-axis.

## Y-Coordinate

It is the perpendicular distance of the point from the _X_-axis.
